# Idle server

The real purpose of this repository:

>A server that hosts the idle-joey game, and exposes it's interactions via http.

# Idle textclient

Just a (temporary) means of playing with the server, without having to create a webapp that communicates over HTTP.

Only direct access to the Controllers of the server is allowed
